# Eclipse IDE

Eclipse is a Java-based IDE.

## Installing

Get the "Eclipse IDE YYYY-MM" from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ or
"Eclipse Installer" from  http://eclipse.bluemix.net/packages/


Unpack the installer in $HOME/eclipse/eclipse-installer

    echo 'exec ~/eclipse/eclipse-installer/eclipse-inst $\*' > ~/bin/eclipse-inst
    chmod 755 ~/bin/eclipse-inst

Start eclipse-inst

Hamburger Menu, Enable Bundle Pools, Enable Advanced Mode

Select the IDE you want from Eclipse.org
Select a bundle pool on $HOME/.p2/pool (saves a LOT of space if you have multiple installations)


    echo 'exec ~/eclipse/latest/eclipse/eclipse $\*' > ~/bin/eclipse
    chmod 755 ~/bin/eclipse
